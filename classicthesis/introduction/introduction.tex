Standard Model precision test for New Physics, flavor sector, strong interaction, first-principles: Lattide Field Theory.

In the lattice, any physical quantity is computed in units of the lattice spacing $a$. For a meson mass for example one really gets from the lattice $am_{\textrm{phys}}$, i.e. a dimensionless number. The task of converting these results into physical units thus entails estimating the value of the lattice spacing $a$ in physical units. This is called scale setting... inputs... Scale setting is a crucial step in the computation of any quantity in the lattice, since any prediction inherits the uncertainty of $a$. Thus, for achieving high-precision lattice predictions, one needs to have a major effort in the scale setting procedure... intermediate scale...

After scale setting, light quark masses determination.

We employ mixed action...

The main motivation to pursue this mixed action approach is to develop a competitive independent lattice setup suited for the study of charm physics. Thanks to automatic $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement in the valence, systematic uncertainties associated with the cutoff effects of the charm quark mass $\mathcal{O}(am_c)$ are kept under control without the need of any improvement coefficient in the charm sector. In addition to this, the mixed action approach represents a different setup from those of other groups and can be used to compute light sector observables independently, enriching the literature of the community.

There is one more advantage of our mixed action approach in the light sector. Thanks to having measurements for both the Wilson unitary and mixed action setups (needed to perform the matching), we will be able to increase statistics in our results. This is due to the fact that they are two different lattice regularizations which have the same continuum limit, although they are correlated since they share the same sea. Analyzing together both set of data allows to further control the continuum limit in the scale setting and determination of the light-strange quark masses (see Secs.~\ref{ch_ss}-\ref{ch_qm}) and reduce statistichal uncertainties.
