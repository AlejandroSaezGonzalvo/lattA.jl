\chapter{Strange Quark Determinant reweighting}
\label{apex_strange_det}

For some ensembles, it was found that the strange quark determinant was negative for some configurations. A reweighting factor of $-1$ is needed in these configurations. The list of effected ensembles and configurations is presented in Table~\ref{}

\begin{table}[H]
