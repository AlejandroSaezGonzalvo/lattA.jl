    \caption{List of CLS ensembles~\citep{Bruno:2014jqa,Mohler:2017wnb} under study. They use the LÃ¼scher-Weisz gauge action defined in eq.~(\ref{ch_foundation:eq:LW}) and non-perturbatively $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved $N_f=2+1$ Wilson fermions (see eq.~(\ref{ch_foundation:eq:DW_impr})). All ensembles use open boundary conditions (OBC) in time except for E250 and D450 (periodic), and periodic boundary conditions for all spatial directions. The last column refers to whether the corresponding ensemble is included in the analysis of charm physics in Chapter \ref{ch_charm}.}
