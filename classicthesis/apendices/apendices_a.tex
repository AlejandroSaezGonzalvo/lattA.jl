    \caption{List of CLS ensembles~\cite{} under study. They use the LÃ¼scher-Weisz gauge action defined in eq.~(\ref{ch_foundation:eq:LW}) and non-perturbatively $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved $N_f=2+1$ Wilson fermions. All ensembles use open boundary conditions in time except for E250, and periodic boundary conditions for all spatial directions.}
