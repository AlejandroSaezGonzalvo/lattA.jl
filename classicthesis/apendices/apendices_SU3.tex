\chapter{Gell-Mann matrices and structure constants}
\label{apex_SU3}

In this Appendix we give the expressions for the $SU(3)$ group generators in the fundamental representation, given by the Gell-Mann matrices, and the values for the $su(3)$ algebra structure constants.


The Gell-Mann matrices are given by
\begin{align}
T^{(1)}&=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},\;
T^{(2)}=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -i & 0 \\ 
i & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},\;
T^{(3)}=\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \nonumber \\
T^{(4)}&=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},\;
T^{(5)}=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & -i \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
i & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},\;
T^{(6)}=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \nonumber \\
T^{(7)}&=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -i \\ 
0 & i & 0
\end{pmatrix},\;
T^{(8)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -2
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}

The structure constants of the group $f_{abc}$ are obtained from the commutators of group generators
\begin{equation}
\left[T^{(a)},T^{(b)}\right]=if_{abc}T^{(c)},
\end{equation}
and they are universal, not depending on the choice of the representation. They are totally antisymmetric and given by
\begin{align}
f_{123}&=1,\\
f_{147}&=-f_{156}=f_{246}=f_{257}=f_{345}=-f_{367}=\frac{1}{2},\\
f_{458}&=f_{678}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
\end{align}
and all other $f_{abc}$ not related to the ones above by permuting indices are zero.
