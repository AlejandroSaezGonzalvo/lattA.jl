	Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said \\
	for modern science that it has furnished this proof with \\
	very rich materials increasingly daily, and thus has shown that, \\
	in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically; \\
	that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually \\
	recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution.} \\ \medskip

\begin{flushright}{\slshape
	It is precisely the alteration of nature by men, not solely nature as such, \\
	which is the most essential and immediate basis of human thought.} \\ \medskip
